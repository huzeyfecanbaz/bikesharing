# Bikesharing with NYC CitiBike data

## Overview
The Tableau story can be seen in the link. (https://public.tableau.com/newWorkbook/4b6011ef-6010-4053-a533-3877b359355f#3)

The goal for the project wat to analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City to prepare a presentation for investors looking to begin the same service in Des Moines, Iowa. New York and Des Moines are far away from each other, however, this research gives an idea about the following questions:
- Who uses bikeshare?
- What area of the city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of the day are bikes used the most or vice versa?
- Who used the bikes and how much they used it?

## Results
Results shows that 2,344,224 bikers used the CitiBikes in August at the NYC.

The picture above shows that %75 of the users are Subscribers which means the people who use the bikes regularly and contributing the program's income.

The picture above belong to the recorded bike trips from their started points. The coler of the circles are changing from the lighter to darker based on the number of trips started at those locations. The picture also gives an idea that the downtown and the places where the toursits and traffic getting higher have the high rate of the bike usage while the neighborhoods have the less.

The chart above represents the bike ride numbers in each hour of the day, summed across the month of August. It can be understood that the bike use is increasing during the rush hour and end-of-workday commute times. Additionally, it is exhibited that low bike use hours are between 2 AM and 5 AM. The low bike use times are the most appropriate times to do maintenance for the bikes and redistribution.

In this project, a heat map generated to show weekly usage patterns. The heat map supported the most bike usage hours during the weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread through the middle of the day. However, the heat map also shows that Wednesday's end-of-day commute has the low bike usage. This point gives more further research are to the researchers.

A stepped-level heatmap created to provide more opportunity to see the proportion of the bikes get more use. This tiling shows each individual bike in the fleet, sized, colored, and sorted by its degree of usage during the month. In red we can see a small number of bikes that get heavy usage, which will require more regular repair, or possibly even replacement. In shades of green, we can see all the other bikes that get much lower levels of use, and will probably not need to be repaired as often.

The graph above show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. More specifically, most trips are under a half-hour in length, with a swift dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.

This breakdown of number of rides by duration, separated by gender, makes it even more apparent how many more rides are taken by male-identifying customers.

Lastly, this heatmap reinforces how much of the userbase is dominated by male-identifying, subscribing users. Why this is the case is unclear and warrants additional study.

## Summary
In summary, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.
The research has more points to go through;
- trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours,
- average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.
